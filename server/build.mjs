/* RPGAtlas — server/build.mjs
   Bundle the Node Beacon server into a single runnable ESM file
   (server/dist/beacon.mjs). The core imports the shared sim + protocol from
   ../../src/shared, so esbuild inlines them — the deployed binary needs no
   RPGAtlas source tree, just Node + the `ws` dependency. GPL-3.0. */
