# Harbor H6 — Migration, docs & release (spec)

**Phase:** H6 of Project Harbor (`docs/PROJECT_FOLDERS_ROADMAP.md`) — the final phase.
**Author:** Claude Opus 4.8 (High), 2026-07-09
**Release gate:** Claude Fable 5 (a fresh conversation, after H6·C).
**Builds on:** the signed on-disk contract + native plumbing (`docs/harbor-1-spec.md`,
`harbor-1`), the desktop Project Manager launcher (`docs/harbor-2-spec.md`, `harbor-2`),
project-scoped saving (`docs/harbor-3-spec.md`, `harbor-3`), per-project assets
(`docs/harbor-4-spec.md`, `harbor-4`), and launch-from-the-folder (`docs/harbor-5-spec.md`,
`harbor-5`). H6 is the *finish*: the workflow works end-to-end (create/open a game folder,
paste assets in, save into the folder, double-click to launch); H6 makes sure no existing
user is stranded, writes the story down, rebuilds the desktop exe against the shipped
frontend, and cuts **RPGAtlas 1.2.0**.

**Non-negotiables carried from H1–H5 / the roadmap:**
- **Desktop-first, browser-safe (trap 4).** Everything H6·A adds is gated behind
  `managerActive()` (desktop `isTauri` **or** the H2·D `?fakehost` hook). The pure browser
  build is byte-identical: it never mounts the manager, so it never offers migration; the
  70 original Playwright specs pass **unmodified**. Desktop flows are e2e-covered through
  the `?fakehost` host, additively.
- **The e2e boot gate (trap 1).** `#save-ind` ships hidden and is revealed **last** by
  `boot()`. The migration wizard is a Project Manager screen — it never touches `#save-ind`;
  the gate opens only once the child commits and the editor boots on the new folder game.
- **No new webview windows (trap 2).** H6 adds no windows; the migration wizard renders
  inside `main`, exactly like the New/Open flows.
- **vitest is env=node (trap 3).** The migration decision is a pure core in `src/shared`
  (`folder-migration.ts`) with no `window`/DOM/schema import (the `isProjectLike` predicate
  is injected); the wizard UI + localStorage reads live in the editor.
- **The exe embeds the frontend (trap 6).** H1–H5 shipped **no exe** — the whole workflow
  is drivable in the browser through `?fakehost`. H6·C rebuilds `RPGAtlas-Desktop.exe`
  (`npm run package:exe`) against the final frontend and commits it (killing any running
  instance first so the file lock doesn't abort git ops).
- **Files stay where users put them (locked decision 6).** Migration COPIES the used
  global-library assets into the new folder (the existing H4 bridge); it never moves or
  deletes the source. The global app-data library and its import inbox keep their code for
  migration; H6·B retires them from the *docs*.
- **Version lives in ~7 sites (trap 8).** `package.json`, `package-lock.json` (root),
  `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`, `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`, `src-tauri/Cargo.lock` (the
  `rpgatlas` crate), the README badge, and `help.ts`'s About box — all move to **1.2.0** at
  H6·C, together with the `patch-notes.js?v=` / `editor.css?v=` cache-busters
  (`help.ts` + `shims.d.ts`, index.html). **FORMAT_VERSION stays 2**; the plugin API stays
  frozen for 1.x.

---

## 0. What H6 delivers (and does not)

**Delivers (per stage):**
- **H6·A — Legacy migration.** A desktop user who had a game before Project Harbor (it
  lives only in the localStorage mirror, with no folder) is greeted on launch by a one-click
  "let's put your game in a folder" wizard: the name is prefilled from the game's title, and
  committing scaffolds a real folder from the stored document and copies the game's used
  global-library pictures/sounds into it (the H4 bridge). The old path never strands anyone.
- **H6·B — Docs & story.** Wiki pages ("Your game is a folder", "Adding your own art and
  music"), a docs-site rebuild, a README pass, a gentle browser-build File-menu note that
  project folders live in the desktop app, and retiring the global app-data import inbox
  from the docs (the code stays for migration).
- **H6·C — Release.** A full regression sweep (all gates + the Harbor specs), a rebuilt
  `RPGAtlas-Desktop.exe`, the version bump to **1.2.0** across every site, and a patch note.
  Then **STOP** for the Fable 5 release gate; after the signed verdict lands in the roadmap
  header, tag `harbor-6` + `v1.2.0` and push the tags.

**Does NOT (out of scope, by design):**
- **No filesystem watcher, no auto-migration.** Migration is always the child's explicit,
  one-click choice (with a "Not now" escape hatch); nothing is moved behind their back.
- **No removal of the global app-data library / inbox code.** It survives to power
  migration; only the *docs* stop pointing new users at it.
- **No installer / signing work.** As at H5, the portable exe ships; `fileAssociations` is
  configured and documented.

## 1. H6·A — Legacy migration

### 1.1 The signal

Before Project Harbor, a desktop game lived only in the localStorage mirror
(`rpgatlas_project`) — there was no folder on disk. After Harbor the desktop app boots to
the Project Manager (H2), so that old game is now *behind* the launcher, reachable only
through migration. We must detect it precisely and never nag a game that already has a
folder.

The discriminator is the mirror **bookkeeping** (`atlas.mirror.meta`, H3): a folder game
always writes meta on save; a pre-Harbor localStorage-only game has a mirror but **no
meta**. So the legacy signal is exactly:

> `peekMirror()` is a recognizable project document **AND** `peekMirrorMeta()` is null.

Once the child migrates and the editor boots on the new folder, the first save writes meta
for the new root — so the signal clears and the offer is **self-extinguishing**
(idempotent). The mirror itself is left in place; it simply becomes the new folder game's
crash-recovery copy (H3).

### 1.2 The pure core

`src/shared/folder-migration.ts` (env=node, vitest — trap 3):
- `planFolderMigration(mirror, hasMeta, isProjectLike) → { title, documentJson } | null` —
  null when there is no mirror, when meta is present (already a folder game), or when the
  mirror isn't a recognizable project (cleared / junk storage). `isProjectLike` is injected
  so the core has no schema/DOM dependency.
- `migrationTitle(doc)` — the prefilled game name (`system.title`, trimmed, friendly
  fallback `"My Game"`).

### 1.3 The wizard

`src/editor/project-manager/manager.ts`:
- `launchManager()` gains a fourth priority, after the in-session `pendingOpen` (1) and the
  H5 launch path (2) and before the plain launcher (4): **(3) if `currentMigrationPlan()`
  is non-null, `showMigration(plan)`** — the returning pre-Harbor user meets the wizard
  first, not an empty launcher.
- `renderMigrateForm` — a New-Project-shaped screen minus the template chooser: a friendly
  intro, the name prefilled from the game's title (with the live folder-safe preview), a
  parent-directory picker, **Put my game in a folder** (primary), and **Not now**. Commit →
  `migrateToFolder` → `host.create(parentDir, leaf, plan.documentJson)` → the shared
  `bootChosen` pipeline. Because a folder game boots, `bootWithProject`'s existing H4 legacy
  bridge (`migrateGlobalLibraryAssets`) copies the game's used global-library assets into
  the new folder and the "We tidied up your game" notice fires — migration is self-contained
  for free.
- `renderLanding` shows a **`.pm-migrate` banner** whenever the signal persists, so **Not
  now** is never a dead end — the offer stays one click away.
- `mountManagerCard()` factored out of `showProjectManager` so `showMigration` shares the
  overlay/toast scaffolding.

### 1.4 e2e (browser, `?fakehost`)

Additive specs in `tests-e2e/project-manager.spec.mjs` ("Legacy → folder migration
(H6·A)"): seed `rpgatlas_project` **without** `atlas.mirror.meta` → the wizard greets on
launch with the title prefilled; committing scaffolds `/Games/<Name>`, copies a seeded
global-library asset into the folder index, fires the tidy-up notice, and boots (title +
`#save-ind`); **Not now** drops to the launcher with the banner (which re-opens the wizard);
a mirror **with** meta is never offered migration. The pure browser build (no `?fakehost`)
never mounts the manager, so the 70 originals are untouched.

## Stage log

### H6·A — Legacy migration — 2026-07-09

**Shipped:** a returning pre-Harbor desktop user is met by a one-click "put your game in a
folder" wizard instead of an empty launcher; the old localStorage-only game becomes a real,
self-contained folder game.

- **Pure core `src/shared/folder-migration.ts` (new, vitest):** `planFolderMigration(mirror,
  hasMeta, isProjectLike)` — the legacy signal is "mirror is a project **and** no folder
  meta"; returns `{ title, documentJson }` (document passed through verbatim) or null. Meta
  present → null (already a folder game); no mirror / junk / non-project → null.
  `migrationTitle(doc)` derives the prefilled name from `system.title` (trimmed; fallback
  `"My Game"`). No `window`/DOM/schema import — `isProjectLike` is injected. Covered by
  `tests-unit/folder-migration.test.ts` (9 cases: every null guard, the offer case,
  title trim/fallback).
- **`manager.ts`:** `launchManager()` priority is now (1) in-session `pendingOpen` → (2) H5
  launch path → **(3) H6·A migration (`showMigration`)** → (4) launcher.
  `currentMigrationPlan()` reads `peekMirror()`/`peekMirrorMeta()` (already imported from
  persistence) through the pure core. `renderMigrateForm` (intro + prefilled name + folder
  picker + **Put my game in a folder** / **Not now**) → `migrateToFolder` →
  `host.create(parentDir, leaf, plan.documentJson)` → `bootChosen`. The **used
  global-library assets are copied for free** by `bootWithProject`'s existing H4 bridge
  (`migrateGlobalLibraryAssets`) since a folder game boots — no new asset code. `renderLanding`
  shows a `.pm-migrate` banner while the signal persists (so **Not now** isn't a dead end).
  `mountManagerCard()` factored out of `showProjectManager`, shared with `showMigration`.
- **CSS (`css/editor.css`):** `.pm-intro` (wizard blurb) + `.pm-migrate*` (landing banner) —
  additive; the `editor.css?v=` cache-buster bump is bundled at H6·C with the version bump
  (as H4 did — the browser never mounts the manager, so the styles are inert there and the
  desktop exe rebuilds at H6·C).
- **e2e (`tests-e2e/project-manager.spec.mjs`, additive):** 4 new specs (wizard greets +
  name prefilled; commit scaffolds the folder + copies the global asset + fires the tidy-up
  notice + boots; **Not now** → launcher + banner → re-open; a folder-game mirror with meta
  is never offered). `#save-ind` stays hidden until the editor boots in every pre-commit
  case (the gate holds, trap 1).
- **No recovery-prompt regression:** `decideRecovery` returns `use-folder` when
  `mirrorMeta == null` (the legacy case), and the folder is created *from* the mirror, so
  migration never trips a spurious "bring your changes back?" prompt.
- **Gates:** vitest **977** (968 + 9) · node **19** · Playwright **107/107** (103 + 4) ·
  eslint **0** · typecheck **clean**. No patch note / version / cache-buster bump yet — H6·C
  bundles the H6 note + the 1.2.0 bump. `patch-notes.js?v=65`, `editor.css?v=61`,
  `data.js?v=31`, FORMAT_VERSION 2, version 1.1.0 — unchanged this stage.
- Git ritual: branch `harbor-6a` → gates green → commit → merge to `main` → delete branch.
  **Next: H6·B (docs & story).**

### H6·B — Docs & story — 2026-07-09

**Shipped:** the project-folders story is written down for players (wiki + docs-site +
README), the old app-data import inbox is retired from the docs, and the pure browser build
gains a gentle "your folders live in the desktop app" note in its File menu.

- **New wiki pages:** `wiki/Your-Game-Is-a-Folder.md` (the desktop project-folder model — the
  Project Manager, the folder layout, autosave-into-the-folder + backups + Ctrl+S, opening by
  double-click, backing up / zipping / moving, and the H6·A migration) and
  `wiki/Adding-Your-Own-Art-and-Music.md` (the `assets/` drop-folders, copy-paste + focus
  scan + the slicer, files-stay-put + the friendly missing state, self-contained folders).
  Both cross-link and each closes with a "using the web version instead" note.
- **Wiki wiring:** `_Sidebar.md` links both new pages; `Home.md` adds the folder page to the
  "new here?" path; `The-Asset-Browser.md` **retires the app-data inbox** — the old
  "per-device library — IndexedDB in the browser, the app-data folder in the desktop app"
  line is replaced with the real split (desktop = the game's own `assets/` folder; web = the
  per-device IndexedDB library) and points at the new pages; `Characters-and-Custom-Assets.md`
  gains a desktop `assets/` pointer atop its (still-valid, source-checkout) shared-`img/` docs.
- **docs-site:** rebuilt with `node scripts/build-docs-site.mjs` → **22 pages** (20 + the 2
  new), sidebar links resolve, internal links verified.
- **README:** new **"Your game is a folder (desktop app)"** section (Project Manager, the
  folder tree, autosave, drop-in assets, zip/move/back-up, Export, migration) with the
  double-click section demoted under it; a desktop `assets/` pointer in "Custom assets"; and a
  desktop-folder note in "Project format". (README version badge stays 1.1.0 → bumps at H6·C.)
- **Browser File-menu note (`src/editor/workspace.ts`):** a new `desktop-folders` command
  (**"Where's my game saved?…"** → a kid-friendly modal naming the desktop app + folders),
  registered and shown in the File menu **only when `!managerActive()`** — i.e. the pure web
  build. Desktop (`isTauri`) and the `?fakehost` e2e host, whose games already live in
  folders, never see it, so the manager menus and the frozen-70 desktop parity are unchanged.
  `FILE_ITEMS` is computed per build so the item slots in only on the web.
- **i18n parity (trap: the i18n anti-rot gate scans `workspace.ts` `label:`):** the two new
  chrome strings the note introduces — **"Where's my game saved?…"** (the command label) and
  **"Got it"** (its modal button, rendered through `t()`) — are translated in **all 10
  locales** (`js/editor/i18n.js`), keeping `i18n-parity.test.ts` green (31/31).
- **e2e (`tests-e2e/desktop-note.spec.mjs`, new, additive, browser build — no `?fakehost`):**
  opens the File menu, finds the note, opens the modal (names the desktop app + folders),
  dismisses it. The existing browser specs are untouched (a new file).
- **Gates:** vitest **977** · node **19** · Playwright **108/108** (107 + 1 note) · eslint
  **0** · typecheck **clean**. No product-version / cache-buster bump yet (H6·C). Docs and the
  browser-only note are inert to the desktop exe (rebuilt at H6·C).
- Git ritual: branch `harbor-6b` → gates green → commit → merge to `main` → delete branch.
  **Next: H6·C (release — gate sweep, exe rebuild, 1.2.0 bump, patch notes, then STOP for
  the Fable 5 release gate).**

### H6·C — Release (prep) — 2026-07-09

**Shipped:** the full regression sweep, the rebuilt desktop exe, the **1.2.0** version bump
across every site, and the release patch note. This stage STOPS before tagging — the Fable 5
release gate signs the roadmap header first, then `harbor-6` + `v1.2.0` are tagged.

- **Full gate sweep (all green):** vitest **977** · node **19** · cargo **23** (19 pure-core
  + 4 launch; `project`/`project_paths`/`launch` suites) · Playwright **108/108** (70 frozen
  browser + 25 manager (H2/H3/H6·A) + 6 assets (H4) + 6 launch (H5) + 1 browser note (H6·B)) ·
  eslint **0** · typecheck **clean** · i18n-parity **31/31**.
- **Rebuilt `RPGAtlas-Desktop.exe` (trap 6):** killed any running instance first, then
  `npm run package:exe` (`stage-frontend.mjs` → `vite build` staged into `src-tauri/dist`,
  then `cargo build --release`, copied to the project root). The exe compiled as
  `rpgatlas v1.2.0` and embeds the H1–H6 frontend (Project Manager, folder saving, per-project
  assets, launch, and the H6·A migration wizard). It had been stale since Jul 6 (pre-Harbor);
  H1–H5 shipped no exe by design, so this is the first Harbor exe. Cargo is at
  `C:\Users\Zatara\.cargo\bin` (prepended to PATH; trap 7).
- **Version → 1.2.0 across all sites (trap 8):** `package.json`, `package-lock.json` (root +
  `packages[""]`), `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`, `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`, `src-tauri/Cargo.lock`
  (the `rpgatlas` crate), the `README.md` badge, and `src/editor/help.ts`'s About box.
  **FORMAT_VERSION stays 2**; the plugin API stays frozen for 1.x.
- **Cache-busters:** `patch-notes.js?v=65 → 66` (`help.ts` import + `shims.d.ts` module
  declaration) for the new note; `editor.css?v=61 → 62` (`index.html`) for the H6·A wizard/
  banner styles. `data.js?v=31` unchanged (no `js/data.js` change this phase).
- **Patch note (`js/patch-notes.js`, prepended):** "Turn your older game into a folder
  (RPGAtlas 1.2.0)" — kid-friendly; names the one-click legacy migration wizard (prefilled
  name + copied art/audio), the "Not now" → launcher banner, the new help pages, and the web
  build's File-menu "Where's my game saved?" note. Web saving unchanged.
- **Roadmap header:** updated to record H1–H6 landed on `main` and **Release-gate verdict
  (Fable 5): pending** — the placeholder where the signed verdict lands before tagging.
- **STOP for the Fable 5 release gate.** Per the roadmap (locked decision 1 + the H6·C
  kickoff), a fresh Fable 5 conversation audits the phase exits against this roadmap and
  records the signed verdict in the header. Only after that do `harbor-6` + `v1.2.0` get
  tagged and pushed. This conversation does **not** tag.
- Git ritual: branch `harbor-6c` → gates green → commit → merge to `main` → delete branch
  (no tag yet — the tags wait on the Fable verdict).

### Release gate — Claude Fable 5 — 2026-07-09

**Verdict: ✅ SIGNED — release approved.** A fresh Fable 5 conversation audited the H6
phase exits against the roadmap; the signed verdict lives in the roadmap header. Highlights
of the independent audit (beyond re-running every gate, all green — vitest 977 · node 19 ·
cargo 23 · Playwright 108/108 · eslint 0 · typecheck clean):

- **H6·A:** `planFolderMigration` guards verified (null mirror / meta present / junk →
  null); `host.create(parentDir, leaf, documentJson)` signature matches the wizard's call;
  `decideRecovery` returns `use-folder` for `mirrorMeta == null`, so migration can never
  trip a spurious recovery prompt; the e2e specs genuinely assert the copied asset via
  `readAssetIndex` and hold the `#save-ind` gate closed pre-commit (trap 1).
- **H6·B:** the note is registered and slotted into `FILE_ITEMS` only when
  `!managerActive()`; `modal()` renders button labels through `t()` (modals.ts), so the 10
  locale entries for "Got it" are live, not dead keys; docs-site = 22 pages, sidebar wired.
- **H6·C:** 1.2.0 verified in package.json, package-lock (root + `packages[""]`),
  tauri.conf.json, Cargo.toml, Cargo.lock (`rpgatlas`), README badge, help.ts About;
  exe ProductVersion/FileVersion 1.2.0 and build timeline confirms it embeds the final
  staged frontend (`src-tauri/dist/index.html` carries `editor.css?v=62`, staged before
  the cargo build); patch note is clean UTF-8; FORMAT_VERSION stays 2.

No defects found; nothing to fix. Tagged `harbor-6` + `v1.2.0` and pushed. **Project
Harbor is complete.**
