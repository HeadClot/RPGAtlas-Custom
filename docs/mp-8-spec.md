## Objective

Friend rooms become worlds. Stage A (Fable) cuts the architecture: zone-per-map
sharding behind a location-agnostic seam, chunked area-of-interest filtering,
the cross-zone transfer handoff, passport identity, the tick-strategy
measurement + decision, and the persistence *design*. Stage B (Opus) does the
breadth: the bot load harness + CI target, durable persistence per the
branch-point answer, the Cloudflare DO world target, and the per-zone event
runtime (the D-5-0/D-6-0/D-7-0 unfreeze — see §B).

The three-tier model after MP8:

| Tier | Server core | Identity | Broadcast | Sim |
|------|-------------|----------|-----------|-----|
| Friend room (2–16) | `BeaconServer`/`BeaconRoom` (MP5, **untouched**) | anonymous (name only, D3) | 60 Hz, full roster | player layer (world runtime → MP8·B) |
| Zone (~200/map) | `BeaconWorld` + `Zone` (NEW) | **passport** | 12 Hz + AOI (measured, §A4) | 60 Hz, player layer now; engine runtime = stage B |
| World (1000+) | `BeaconWorld`, zones sharded | passport | per zone | per zone |

---

## Stage A — architecture, passport, measurement (Fable, landed 2026-07-20)

### §A1 Passport identity + protocol arms (commit A1)

**`src/shared/net/passport.ts`** (NEW, pure, DOM-free — runs in browsers,
Node ≥ 20, workerd):

- ECDSA **P-256 + SHA-256 via WebCrypto** — deliberately boring: the one
  signature suite green across every runtime this project ships on. (Ed25519
  rejected: WebCrypto support still uneven.) Keys are extractable BY DESIGN —
  the passport must export to a file to move devices (D3); the file is the
  same trust tier as a save file and the docs will say so (MP9).
- A passport is exactly `{v, kind, name, created, publicKeyJwk,
  privateKeyJwk}` — **no PII by construction** (asserted by test).
- Auth flow: connect → server `challenge {nonce}` (24-byte CSPRNG) → client
  `hello {…, pub, sig}` where `sig` = ECDSA over the **domain-separated**
  nonce (`"rpgatlas-passport-v1:" + nonce`) → server `verifyChallenge` →
  `fingerprintOfPub` (SHA-256 of the raw key, base64url, 43 chars) is the
  player's identity key (records + bans). Per-connection nonce ⇒ a captured
  signature replays into nothing. Verify fails closed on ANY garbage.
- `encodePassportFile`/`decodePassportFile`: strict import validation — a
  hostile or corrupt file returns null, never crashes, never half-loads.

**`src/engine/net/passport-store.ts`** (NEW): device custody — localStorage
key `rpgatlas_passport`, auto-created on first use (a kid never sees a
signup), corrupt storage heals by re-creating, rename keeps keys,
export/import text helpers. Injectable KV store ⇒ headless-tested. UI wiring
(export/import buttons in the world-join flow) rides stage B with the i18n.

**Protocol (additive within v1, the MP0/D-6-3 precedent — no version bump):**
`hello` gains optional `pub`/`sig` (base64url, structurally validated);
new server frames `challenge {nonce}` and `handoff {mapId, token, url?}`
(the socket-per-zone transfer for the CF DO world, stage B — defined + wire-
tested now so the client can be built against it); error code `auth-failed`;
kick code `replaced`. Friend-room relays send no challenge and ignore
`pub`/`sig` — **friend rooms stay fully anonymous** (D3).

i18n: `kickReplaced` added to EN + all ten packs → the Beacon mp-i18n parity
set is now **34 keys/pack** (was 33).

### §A2 Zone architecture (commit A2)

**Zone = map.** `server/src/core/zone.ts`: one `Zone` wraps one headless sim
`World` pinned to one map — membership, buffered move intents, authoritative
grid movement (the same `motion.ts` + `collision.ts` the MP5 room uses),
anti-stack, emote/say/custom relay, directive routing (the MP5 seam kept
live), decimated broadcast (§A4), chunked AOI (§A3).

**The sharding seam.** Everything a zone consumes is fire-and-forget calls
(`ZoneApi`: admit/remove/frame/requestSnapshot/applyShared/tick/stop) and
everything it produces leaves through a fire-and-forget outbox (`ZoneOutbox`:
send/sendMany/transferOut/sharedSet/recordPatch). **No return values cross
the boundary** — snapshots are PUSHED by the zone (admit/requestSnapshot →
outbox), so the SAME class runs in-process, behind a worker_threads
MessagePort, or inside a Durable Object without changing a line. This is the
load-bearing design decision of the phase.

**`server/src/core/beacon-world.ts`** — the world directory:

- Connections + the MP5 hardening pipeline (byte cap → token bucket → strict
  decode → route; strikes close floods). **Deliberately duplicated** from
  `BeaconServer` rather than refactored, so the MP5-security-audited room path
  stays byte-identical; same constants, same semantics (§A6).
- Passport gate: challenge on connect; async verify with a small frame queue
  (a pipelined `join` right behind the `hello` parks, cap 8, overflow =
  strike); ban-by-fingerprint (live kick + refused at the door); **one live
  session per passport** — a new sign-in supersedes the old (kick
  `replaced`), so a crashed session never locks a player out.
- Player table: world-unique pids, world-scoped resume tokens (rotated on
  use, **fingerprint-bound** — a stolen token without the matching passport
  is refused, ambiguous error, no oracle), resume-grace reaping.
- Zone lifecycle: get-or-create per occupied map (`zoneFactory` injectable —
  the sharding adapters plug in here), occupancy tracked directory-side,
  empty-zone TTL expiry.
- **Cross-zone transfer handoff, gateway model** (Node): the socket never
  moves. `transferPlayer(pid, mapId, x?, y?, dir?)` = exit-position capture →
  old zone `remove` (presence leave to its interest set) → new zone
  `admit` → the new zone pushes a fresh `snapshot` (client re-renders exactly
  like a late join). Stage B's transfer events drive this same API through
  `ZoneOutbox.transferOut`. The CF DO world uses the `handoff` frame instead
  (client reconnects to the target zone DO with a transfer token — stage B).
- World-shared state (§A5 partition): directory-owned `shared` map fanned out
  to every zone replica and **replayed into fresh zones** on creation.
- Passport-keyed **player records** (in-memory in stage A): position + `data`
  bag; refreshed 1 Hz + on every leave/transfer path; a rejoin with the same
  passport lands where you left off. Stage B makes them durable (§A5).

**Per-zone runtime (the D-5-0/D-6-0/D-7-0 boundary).** The zone runs the
player layer today, exactly like the MP5 room. The stage-A survey confirmed
the unlock for stage B: `tests/mp-commands.test.js` already runs the REAL
interpreter registry headlessly in a bare vm with a tiny `window.RPGAtlasDeps`
stub + `initInterpServices`. Because the engine's module-level `G`/`ctx` bind
to ONE default world through the MP1 compat shim, **one zone per
process/worker is what makes the engine event runtime usable server-side
unchanged**: the zone worker binds the default world to its zone's world and
esbuild-bundles the engine slice (interpreter + map runtime driver), stubbing
the presentation port with the directive broker that is already wired. That
is why the seam ships now and why worker sharding exists even though the
player layer alone doesn't need it (§A4). Events/NPCs/encounters on the
server = **stage B** (deviation D-8-0).

### §A3 Sharding adapters

- **In-process (default):** the directory calls the `Zone` directly;
  `startNodeWorldServer` drives `tickZones()` at a drift-compensated 60 Hz.
- **worker_threads (`--world --zone-workers`):** `server/src/node/
  zone-worker.ts` (a second esbuild bundle, `dist/zone-worker.mjs`) runs one
  zone per thread, self-ticking; `worker-zone.ts` marshals the ZoneApi/outbox
  ops over the MessagePort. Position mirror at 1 Hz + exit patches (stamped
  with the zone's mapId; the directory drops patches from a zone the player
  already left) + 5 s drop-tombstones keep records fresh across the boundary.
  Proven end-to-end by `tests-unit/zone-worker.test.ts` (real threads, real
  timers → lives in the isolated `test:net` suite per the MP5 rule).
- **Cloudflare DO (stage B):** one DO per zone + a world-directory DO; the
  socket terminates ON the zone DO (that's what DO WebSockets are), so
  cross-zone transfer uses the `handoff` frame (reconnect with a transfer
  token). The directory DO owns records/shared/bans in DO storage; a zone DO
  snapshots its own state (§A5) — that closes MP5·B's documented
  "hibernation eviction resets the room" boundary for worlds.

**Windows timer discovery (real defect fixed in stage A):** a
`setInterval(16.7 ms)` quantizes to ~31 ms on Windows in worker threads AND
in the world gateway process — the sim ran at ~32 Hz (half speed: slow
motion, doubled echo latency; measured p50 126 ms before, 64 ms after).
Both world drivers (zone-worker + startNodeWorldServer) now use a
drift-compensated loop: an 8 ms interval that advances however many whole
60 Hz ticks of wall time elapsed (capped at 30 so a stall can't spiral).
The MP5 room driver is untouched (audited; its measured numbers were and
remain within budget). The stage-B DO zone driver must use the same pattern.

### §A4 Tick strategy — MEASUREMENT + DECISION

**Question (roadmap):** 60 Hz broadcast vs decimation + interpolation. The
sim rate itself is not a knob — motion constants are per-tick — so this is
about the *state broadcast* cadence.

**Headless matrix** (`server/bench/tick-strategy.mjs`: one 128×128 zone,
10 sim-seconds per config, hold-to-walk bots, dev box, 2026-07-20):

| players | bcast | AOI | CPU ms/sim-s | KB/s/client | zone MB/s |
|--------:|------:|:---:|-------------:|------------:|----------:|
| 50 | 60 Hz | off | 5.1 | 371.5 | 18.14 |
| 50 | 60 Hz | on | 19.0 | 50.9 | 2.48 |
| 50 | 20 Hz | off | 1.6 | 122.8 | 6.00 |
| 50 | 20 Hz | on | 6.2 | 16.8 | 0.82 |
| 50 | 12 Hz | off | 0.9 | 74.3 | 3.63 |
| 50 | 12 Hz | on | 3.8 | 10.2 | 0.50 |
| 50 | 6 Hz | off | 0.6 | 37.0 | 1.81 |
| 50 | 6 Hz | on | 2.0 | 5.1 | 0.25 |
| 100 | 60 Hz | off | 6.9 | 738.8 | 72.15 |
| 100 | 60 Hz | on | 47.1 | 94.3 | 9.21 |
| 100 | 20 Hz | off | 2.6 | 244.5 | 23.87 |
| 100 | 20 Hz | on | 15.5 | 31.2 | 3.05 |
| 100 | 12 Hz | off | 1.8 | 147.8 | 14.43 |
| 100 | 12 Hz | on | 10.0 | 18.9 | 1.84 |
| 100 | 6 Hz | off | 1.2 | 73.6 | 7.18 |
| 100 | 6 Hz | on | 5.4 | 9.4 | 0.92 |
| 200 | 60 Hz | off | 14.4 | 1484.2 | 289.88 |
| 200 | 60 Hz | on | 106.3 | 185.0 | 36.13 |
| 200 | 20 Hz | off | 5.6 | 491.7 | 96.03 |
| 200 | 20 Hz | on | 35.5 | 61.3 | 11.97 |
| **200** | **12 Hz** | **on** | **22.4** | **37.0** | **7.23** |
| 200 | 12 Hz | off | 4.2 | 296.9 | 57.99 |
| 200 | 6 Hz | off | 2.9 | 147.9 | 28.88 |
| 200 | 6 Hz | on | 12.4 | 18.4 | 3.60 |
| 400 | 60 Hz | off | 29.9 | 2968.1 | 1159.43 |
| 400 | 60 Hz | on | 205.1 | 352.0 | 137.50 |
| 400 | 20 Hz | off | 12.9 | 984.9 | 384.74 |
| 400 | 20 Hz | on | 69.9 | 116.8 | 45.63 |
| 400 | 12 Hz | off | 10.0 | 593.8 | 231.96 |
| 400 | 12 Hz | on | 45.6 | 70.4 | 27.51 |
| 400 | 6 Hz | off | 7.5 | 296.0 | 115.64 |
| 400 | 6 Hz | on | 25.7 | 35.1 | 13.71 |

**Reading it:** CPU is never the binding constraint — the target config
(200 players, 12 Hz, AOI) costs 22.4 ms per sim-second ≈ **2.2 % of one
core per zone**. The WIRE is the constraint: 60 Hz full-roster at 200
players is **1.48 MB/s per client** (unshippable); decimation (5×) × AOI
(~8× at 200) together cut it **40×** to 37 KB/s/client, 7.2 MB/s/zone.
6 Hz would halve that again but spends up to 167 ms — two-thirds of the
250 ms p95 budget — on cadence alone and makes remote motion visibly steppy.

**Socketed smoke** (`server/bench/world-smoke.mjs`: real WebSockets, real
P-256 challenge sign-ins, bots scattered via `transferPlayer`, hold-to-walk +
emotes every ~3 s; intent→echo INCLUDES the 0–83 ms cadence wait — that is
what a player experiences; dev box, loopback, bots + server share the box so
numbers are conservative):

| config | samples | p50 | p95 | p99 | moved |
|--------|--------:|----:|----:|----:|------:|
| 50 bots / 1 zone (in-proc, pre-timer-fix) | 1,943 | 125.8 | 141.7 | — | 50/50 |
| 50 bots / 1 zone (in-proc) | 3,166 | 64.1 | 79.8 | 80.5 | 50/50 |
| **200 bots / 1 zone (in-proc)** | 17,844 | **58.2** | **83.1** | 84.2 | 200/200 |
| 200 bots / 1 zone (worker) | 17,879 | 66.9 | 82.4 | 83.8 | 200/200 |
| **1000 bots / 8 zones (workers)** | 82,577 | **69.4** | **100.1** | 112.8 | 1000/1000 |
| 1000 bots / 8 zones (in-proc) | 81,337 | 69.7 | 83.6 | 90.7 | 1000/1000 |

Resources at 1000/8 (ONE process = gateway + all bots + zones): in-proc
121 MB rss, ~14.4 s user CPU over ~25 s wall; workers 260 MB rss, ~17.2 s.
Zone-tier budget (roadmap: p95 ≤ 250 ms at 200/zone) holds with **3×
headroom**; the 1000/8 world holds with 2.5×.

**DECISION (measured, not assumed):**

1. **Sim stays 60 Hz** everywhere (motion fidelity; intents apply on the
   next sim tick regardless of broadcast cadence).
2. **World zones broadcast at 12 Hz** (`broadcastEveryTicks: 5` in
   `DEFAULT_WORLD_LIMITS`) **with chunked AOI** (§A3). 12 Hz over 20 Hz:
   ~40 % less egress for ≤ 40 ms extra mean echo against a 250 ms budget;
   over 6 Hz: cadence must not dominate the budget.
3. **Friend rooms keep MP5's every-tick full-roster broadcast** — ≤ 16
   players is trivial wire, and the audited room path stays byte-identical.
4. **In-process zones are the Node default.** At player-layer load the
   thread hop costs more than parallelism buys (see 1000/8 table).
   `--zone-workers` is the prepared scale-out for stage B's per-zone event
   runtime, when zones become CPU-heavy (the engine interpreter + NPC motion
   change the arithmetic — re-measure then).
5. **Binary/delta encoding: NOT demanded by measurement** at these rates
   (37 KB/s/client peak-config). Stage B skips it unless the event-runtime
   deltas change the numbers; the roadmap's "only if measurement demands"
   clause resolves to *no* for now.
6. Client-side remote-player smoothing (dead reckoning between 12 Hz
   deltas) ships with the browser world-join flow in stage B — bots don't
   render; nothing in stage A needs it.

### §A5 Persistence DESIGN (stage B implements)

**What state lives where** (extends the D-6-1 partition):

| State | Owner | Persistence unit |
|-------|-------|------------------|
| Player position (mapId/x/y/dir) + name | directory record | **PlayerRecord** (passport fingerprint → record) |
| Per-player durable data: `pSwitches[pid]`, and party/inv/gold/wallet slices once zone events run | directory record `data` bag (zones push via `recordPatch`) | PlayerRecord |
| World-shared: `switches`, `vars`, `timeOfDay` | directory `shared` map (zones hold replicas; writes fan out via `sharedSet`) | **WorldSnapshot** (+ bans) |
| Zone-local: `selfSw` (keys are map-scoped), event runtime positions/pages, respawn timers (stage B) | the zone's world | **ZoneSnapshot** per mapId |
| Runtime-only (never persisted): rosters, directives in flight, parties, co-op battles, resume tokens, connections | — | — (the MP4/MP5 precedent) |

**Write cadence:** PlayerRecord — refreshed in memory at 1 Hz + every
leave/transfer (already true in stage A); flushed durably on leave/reap +
in the periodic batch. WorldSnapshot + ZoneSnapshots — every ~30 s
(staggered per zone) + on empty-zone expiry + graceful shutdown. **Crash
loss budget: ≤ 30 s of world state, ≤ 30 s of player state** — documented
honestly in the Hosting-a-World docs (MP9).

**Storage adapter (narrow, async, both targets):**

```ts
interface WorldStore {
  loadWorld(): Promise<{ shared: Record<string, JsonValue>; bans: string[] } | null>;
  saveWorld(w: { shared: ...; bans: ... }): Promise<void>;
  loadRecord(fingerprint: string): Promise<PlayerRecord | null>;
  saveRecords(batch: Array<[string, PlayerRecord]>): Promise<void>;
  loadZone(mapId: number): Promise<ZoneSnapshot | null>;
  saveZone(mapId: number, snap: ZoneSnapshot): Promise<void>;
}
```

- **Cloudflare:** directory DO storage holds world + records (records are
  small; DO storage is SQLite-backed and transactional); each zone DO stores
  its own ZoneSnapshot → hibernation/eviction restores instead of resetting.
- **Node:** ❓ **THE MP8 BRANCH POINT — ANSWERED 2026-07-20 (Driftwood):
  JSON snapshot files** (the recommended option). Zero-dep, atomic-rename
  writes, works on any Node ≥ 20, human-readable; plenty at this scale (a
  1000-player world's records are ~1 MB). Rejected alternatives for the
  default: `node:sqlite` (requires Node ≥ 22.5 — the dev box runs 20.17 and
  self-hosters shouldn't need an upgrade), native better-sqlite3 (breaks the
  zero-dep one-command deploy). The adapter interface ships regardless, so a
  SQLite adapter can slot in later without touching the directory.
- Load-gate criterion ("kill a zone, restore, state intact") = a stage-B e2e
  against the adapter.

### §A6 Security posture (MP5 gate carried forward)

- The world pipeline duplicates the MP5 constants/semantics verbatim (byte
  cap → token bucket → strict decode → route; 20 strikes; join limiter per
  source; ambiguous resume errors). Divergence risk is accepted and
  documented in both file headers; the MP9 audit reads both.
- New inbound surface = `hello.pub/sig` (structurally validated, then
  WebCrypto-verified, fails closed) and the challenge nonce (server-generated
  only). No new client-controlled bytes reach any store un-validated; the
  fingerprint is derived server-side.
- Records are keyed by fingerprint and hold position + game data only —
  **no IP, no PII** (D6 unchanged; `source` still never leaves rate-limit
  buckets). The passport name is the same display name that already crosses
  the wire.
- Anonymous mode (`requirePassport: false`) is TEST/TOOL-ONLY (connection-
  scoped identities; records don't persist across connections) — production
  worlds require passports; the CLI has no flag to disable them.
- 1000 sockets/one source worked only because the bench lifts
  `joinsPerSource` — the limiter itself is unchanged.

### Stage-A deviations ledger

- **D-8-0 (scope):** the per-zone ENGINE runtime (events/NPCs/encounters on
  the server — the D-5-0/D-6-0/D-7-0 promise "MP8·A per-zone runtime") ships
  its SEAM in stage A (zone worlds + directive routing + transferOut/
  sharedSet/recordPatch outbox + the one-zone-per-process insight §A2) but
  the engine-slice driver itself is **stage B work**, alongside the harness.
  Rationale: the roadmap's own MP8·A bullet list scopes stage A to
  architecture/passport/measurement; the stage-B kickoff below carries the
  runtime explicitly so the promise lands inside MP8.
- **D-8-1:** CF DO world target (zone DO + directory DO + `handoff` client
  flow) = stage B; the protocol arm + design land in stage A.
- **D-8-2:** worker-mode position freshness is ≤ 1 s (the 1 Hz mirror) +
  exit patches on every leave/transfer; in-process zones are exact. A
  crash-window of ≤ 1 s of movement is accepted (persistence cadence
  dominates it anyway, §A5).
- **D-8-3:** AOI does not wrap across looping-map seams (loop-edge handling
  is deferred wholesale per D-5-0; the wrap-aware interest neighborhood rides
  with it in stage B's runtime work if a looping map hosts a zone).
- **D-8-4:** client world-join UI (relay-client challenge handling, passport
  hello, world address entry, dead-reckoning smoothing, i18n for the new
  strings) = stage B; the engine ships passport custody + `kickReplaced`
  copy ×11 locales now, and the friend-room flow is untouched.
- **Windows half-rate timer defect** (§A3) found + fixed in both NEW world
  drivers; MP5 room driver deliberately untouched.

## Stage B — work order (Opus)

Per the roadmap MP8·B + the stage-A deviations, in rough order:

1. **Per-zone event runtime (D-8-0).** esbuild-bundle the engine slice
   (interpreter registry + a headless map-runtime driver: NPC/event motion,
   page refresh, triggers, parallels, encounters) into the zone; bind the
   MP1 default-world shim to the zone's world (one zone per process/worker —
   §A2); presentation port = the already-wired directive broker; transfer
   events → `ZoneOutbox.transferOut`; world-switch writes →
   `sharedSet`; per-player switch writes → `recordPatch`. Solo/friend-room
   behavior byte-identical (this runs only in world zones). Carry the MP6
   notes: `world.blocking` refcount vs battle/event overlap; ally-idx
   cross-target tightening with passport loadouts; loadout-order writeback.
2. **Persistence** per the answered branch point (§A5 — **JSON snapshot
   files** as the Node default): the `WorldStore` adapter + atomic-rename
   file store + CF DO storage; flush cadences; kill-a-zone/restore e2e (the
   load-gate criterion).
3. **CF DO world target (D-8-1):** zone DO + directory DO, `handoff`
   reconnect flow, drift-compensated DO tick driver, hibernation restore
   from ZoneSnapshots.
4. **Client world-join (D-8-4):** relay-client handles `challenge` (sign
   with the stored passport), `handoff`, `replaced`; world address entry in
   the Play Together flow; passport export/import UI; dead-reckoning
   smoothing for 12 Hz remote motion; i18n ×10 for every new string.
5. **Load harness + CI target:** grow `bench/world-smoke.mjs` into the
   MP8·B harness (bots that also trigger events + transfer through doors
   once the runtime lands); a small-N smoke in `test:net`; big-N manual.
   Re-measure §A4 WITH the event runtime; revisit decision #4/#5 (workers
   default, encoding) if the numbers move.
6. **Delta/binary encoding:** measurement says NO for the player layer
   (§A4 decision 5) — only revisit if the runtime deltas demand it.

**Stage B gates:** template gates + the two flake-barred net suites 3× +
goldens untouched + the §A4 tables re-run with the runtime + persistence
round-trip e2e. Then the separate **MP8 LOAD GATE** (Fable) re-runs
everything per the roadmap block and tags `beacon-8`.

## Stage B — implementation log (Opus)

**Sequencing (Driftwood, 2026-07-20):** stage B is six PR-sized subsystems;
landing all six to gate quality in one sitting is not realistic, so — asked at
kickoff — Driftwood chose **infra-first**: land the self-contained, fully
testable, load-gate-critical pieces (item 2 persistence, item 5 harness +
re-measure) to green first, then take the per-zone event runtime (1), CF DO
world (3), and client (4) as the next tranche. The work order's "rough order"
clause permits this. Items 1/3/4 remain OPEN — see the hand-off at the end.

### B·2 — Persistence (WorldStore) ✅ landed 2026-07-20

The §A5 durable-persistence design, implemented end-to-end for the Node
default and the Cloudflare storage seam, satisfying the load-gate criterion
("kill a zone, restore, state intact").

**The seam — `server/src/core/store.ts`:**
- `WorldStore` — the one async durable-storage interface. Three units per §A5:
  `WorldSnapshot` (shared switches/vars/timeOfDay + ban list), `PlayerRecord`
  (passport-fingerprint → last position + durable `data` bag; the type MOVED
  here from beacon-world.ts, re-exported for compat), `ZoneSnapshot` (per-map
  zone-local state — `selfSw` now, event-runtime state later via D-8-0).
- `KvWorldStore` over a tiny `AsyncKv` (get/put/delete/list) — records + zones
  are individual keys, world is one key. `MemoryKv`/`MemoryWorldStore` back the
  tests and a `--data`-less run; the SAME class serves the CF DO target over
  DO storage (see `server/src/cf/do-store.ts` `doStorageKv`).
- Defensive normalizers: stored JSON is treated as possibly-corrupt (a
  truncated file from an ungraceful kill reads as an empty unit, never a crash).

**Node default — `server/src/node/file-store.ts`:** `NodeFileWorldStore`, a
zero-dep JSON snapshot directory (`world.json` · `records.json` ·
`zone-<mapId>.json`). Every write is **atomic** (serialize to a sibling temp
file, `rename()` over the target — REPLACE_EXISTING on POSIX and Windows, so a
crash mid-write keeps the old snapshot intact; one retry guards the rare
Windows sharing race). This is the answered branch point: `node beacon.mjs
--world --data ./world-data` persists with nothing beyond Node.

**Directory wiring — `beacon-world.ts`:** optional `store`; `async load()`
restores world+bans+records+zone-snapshots at start (before any connection);
`async flush()` writes only the dirty set (world snapshot if shared/bans moved,
dirty player records, a fresh ZoneSnapshot per live in-process zone). Dirty
tracking on every record mutation (join/transfer/recordPatch/1 Hz sweep) +
`worldDirty` on setShared/ban. `zoneFor` applies a pending ZoneSnapshot on zone
creation; `dropZone` (empty-zone expiry) stashes + persists the snapshot so
selfSw survives expiry. Zone gained in-process `snapshot()`/`restore()`
(read directly like `positionOf` — worker/DO zones push snapshots through the
outbox, wired in Part 3).

**Driver — `ws-server.ts`:** `startNodeWorldServer` is now `async` — it
`await world.load()` before `http.listen`, runs a 30 s flush timer (only when a
store is configured — §A5 crash-loss budget ≤ 30 s), and `close()` awaits a
final `world.flush()` before shutdown (graceful stop loses nothing). CLI: a new
`--data <dir>` flag (`main.ts`) builds the file store; absent ⇒ in-memory
(pre-persistence behavior, byte-identical).

**Deviation D-8-5 (records batch-load):** the §A5 interface sketch had
`loadRecord(fingerprint)` (lazy, per join). Implemented instead as
`loadRecords()` (one batch at `load()`), because it keeps the MP5-audited auth
pipeline (verifyHello → handleJoin) fully **synchronous** — no `await` inserted
into the door — and a 1000-player record set is ~1 MB (§A5), trivial to
preload. File store: one read; DO store: one `list({prefix})`. `zoneIds()`
added to the interface for the same reason (restore knows which zones to load
before anyone arrives).

**Proof — `tests-unit/world-persistence.test.ts` (5 tests, fast pool, no
sockets):** position survives a full build→play→flush→shutdown→rebuild cycle
(the load-gate criterion) over BOTH the in-memory KV store and the real-disk
`NodeFileWorldStore` (asserts the on-disk JSON files parse + carry the tile);
world-shared switches/timeOfDay + bans round-trip (restored ban refuses the
griefer at the door, restored switches replay into a fresh zone); ZoneSnapshot
selfSw round-trips; and WITHOUT a store nothing persists (a restart resets to
the project start — opt-in proven).

**Gate slice (B·2):** server tsc Node 0 · server tsc CF 0 · root tsc 0 ·
eslint 0 · vitest world-persistence 5/5 + beacon-world 13/13 · both server
bundles build. No `js/` `?v=` touched; no golden touched (server-only).

### B·5 — Load harness + CI smoke + re-measure ✅ landed 2026-07-20

**Harness growth — `server/bench/world-smoke.mjs`:** added a persistence
dimension — `--data <dir>` runs the big-N world with a `NodeFileWorldStore`,
and the run reports the flushed snapshot file count + on-disk size + the final
graceful-flush time so an operator can gauge the durable footprint at scale.
The transfer-through-doors bot behavior (scatter via `transferPlayer`) is
already in place from stage A; the "bots that also trigger events" growth waits
on the per-zone event runtime (item 1).

**CI smoke — `tests-unit/world-smoke.test.ts` (net suite):** the harness's
health check, small-N over REAL sockets — (1) N passported bots join one zone,
random-walk, and the p95 intent→echo is asserted inside the ≤ 250 ms zone
budget; (2) a player's position survives a FULL server restart over the socket
(play → graceful close/flush → brand-new world on the same store → the same
passport rejoins at the saved tile) — the kill-a-zone/restore load-gate
criterion end-to-end on the wire. Added to `vitest.net.config.mjs` (isolated
serial, per the MP5 timing rule). Net suite now **10 tests / 5 files**.

**Re-measured §A4 (socketed, dev box, 2026-07-20, WITH the B·2 persistence
changes in place):**

| config | samples | p50 | p95 | p99 | moved | vs stage A |
|--------|--------:|----:|----:|----:|------:|:-----------|
| 50 bots / 1 zone (in-proc) | 3,570 | 64.4 | 80.3 | 81.3 | 50/50 | 64.1 / 79.8 — unchanged |
| 200 bots / 1 zone (in-proc) | 13,881 | 59.5 | 82.7 | 84.3 | 200/200 | 58.2 / 83.1 — unchanged |
| 200 bots / 1 zone (in-proc) **+ --data** | 13,893 | 66.5 | 82.6 | 83.9 | 200/200 | +persistence, p95 flat |
| 1000 bots / 8 zones (workers) | 70,397 | 71.3 | 99.5 | 112.3 | 1000/1000 | 69.4 / 100.1 — unchanged |

The player layer is **untouched by persistence** — the flush is off the hot
path (a 30 s timer; the hot path only sets a dirty bit). **Persistence
footprint:** the 200-player `--data` run wrote **129 bytes/player** (≈ 130 KB
for a 1000-player world — an order under the §A5 ~1 MB estimate) and a graceful
shutdown flush of **4–6 ms**. So the durable world is essentially free at these
scales.

**Decision #4/#5 revisit (item 5):** the player-layer numbers are unchanged, so
both stage-A decisions still hold — **in-process zones stay the Node default**
(the thread hop still costs more than parallelism buys at player-layer load)
and **no binary/delta encoding is demanded** (37 KB/s/client peak stands; the
6 ms flush adds nothing to the wire). The re-measure that could move #4 is the
one WITH the per-zone event runtime (interpreter + NPC motion make zones
CPU-heavier) — that rides item 1, and is called out again in the hand-off.

**Gate slice (B·5):** root tsc 0 · server tsc Node/CF 0 · eslint 0 · **vitest
`test:unit` 1234 → 1232 after moving world-smoke to net-only** (world-persistence
+5 over beacon-7's 1227; world-smoke is real-socket so it's excluded from the
fast pool in BOTH configs, per the MP5 rule) · **net suite 10/10** (beacon-ws 2 ·
relay-client 4 · beacon-load 1 · zone-worker 1 · world-smoke 2) · bench runs
clean at 50/200/1000. No golden or `js/?v=` touched.

*(Full-suite counts for the eventual load gate: fast `test:unit` = **1232**
[84 files], net `test:net` = **10** [5 files]. node --test, cargo, Playwright,
i18n parity all UNTOUCHED by the server-only B·2/B·5 work — the Fable load gate
re-runs them from scratch.)*

### B·1 — Per-zone engine event runtime (D-8-0) ✅ landed 2026-07-20

The headliner: authored NPCs, events, cutscenes, and triggers run
SERVER-SIDE in a world zone, driven by the REAL interpreter registry, with
their world effects reaching players through the already-wired seams.

**The adopt-`defaultWorld` mechanism (§A2 made concrete).** The engine's
interpreter reads game state through the MP1 compat shim — `G` is
`defaultWorld.g`, `ctx.map`/`ctx.evRTs`/`ctx.proj` delegate to `defaultWorld`.
So an engine zone is built with `world: defaultWorld` (new `ZoneOptions.world`):
the zone's world IS the engine default world, and every interpreter read
operates on THIS zone. That is why there is exactly one engine zone per
process/worker — a second binding would fight over the one `defaultWorld`
(guarded: `createZoneEventRuntime` throws on a foreign world or a double bind).
Multi-map engine worlds therefore shard onto worker threads (one map per
worker, each its own module scope = its own `defaultWorld`); a single in-process
engine zone hosts one map.

**The NEW headless driver — `src/engine/net/zone-event-runtime.ts`.** `map.ts` +
`map-runtime.ts` are render/audio-coupled (they prerender canvases, drive the
Renderer, play Music) and cannot be bundled headless, so this module
re-implements the PURE event logic they carry — page resolution
(`pageActive`/`refreshPage`, switch/timeBand/var/selfSw conditions), entity
motion (`updateEntityMotion`/`updateRoute`/`canEntityPass`, static passability
from `collision.ts` + event-vs-event + event-vs-player blocking), and the
`map.ts update()` scheduler (autorun, parallel map + common events, day/night
page refresh, the tick-timer pump) — against the headless sim. The interpreter
registry ITSELF (`interp.ts` + `commands/*`) is headless-bundleable and is
reused verbatim (as `tests/mp-commands.test.js` already proved); the runtime
installs a DOM-free `EngineServices` (the directive `presentation` port from
`sim/directives.ts`, the world-tick timers, `transferPlayer`→outbox, `setRoute`,
the mp-condition getters, headless `RA`/state helpers) and no-ops the
audio/render/battle/menu services a server has no business running.

**The headless bootstrap — `src/engine/net/headless-env.ts`.** A pure
side-effect module (no imports) imported FIRST by the runtime, so ESM order
guarantees it stands up `window.RPGAtlasDeps` (a faithful headless `RA` — the
`byId`/trait/`commonEventEnabled` helpers copied from `js/data.js` — plus inert
`Assets`/`Music`/`Sfx` stubs) and `location` BEFORE `src/shared/deps.ts`
evaluates. This is what lets the engine slice bundle + run in a plain-Node
worker with no DOM.

**The seam — `src/shared/net/zone-runtime.ts`** (DOM-free types both trees
import, so the zone never imports the engine and the engine never imports the
server core): `ZoneRuntime` (start/tick/onAct/onArrive/eventStates/snapshot·
restoreData/noteExternalShared/stop), `ZoneRuntimeContext`, `ZoneRuntimeOutbox`
(the transferOut/sharedSet/recordPatch subset), `ZoneRuntimeFactory`. The
engine's `createZoneEventRuntime` conforms; the server's `ZoneOutbox`
structurally satisfies `ZoneRuntimeOutbox`.

**Zone wiring — `server/src/core/zone.ts`.** Optional `world` (adopt) +
`runtimeFactory`. `tick()` advances players, fires `onArrive` on each completed
step (touch triggers), then `runtime.tick()` (events, before broadcast); an
`act` intent → `onAct` (action triggers); a blocking-participant player is
frozen (`world.blocking.has(pid)` guard — inert without a runtime). `snapshot()`
folds the runtime's event positions into `ZoneSnapshot.data`; `applyShared`
tells the runtime (`noteExternalShared`) so a directory fan-out is never echoed
back out. The delta/snapshot payload gains an additive `events` field ONLY when
a runtime is attached (existing clients ignore it — a runtime-less zone is
byte-identical to MP8·A).

**World-effect propagation = SHADOW DIFFING (reuse the audited commands
unchanged).** The switch/var/selfsw commands write `G` directly (the MP7-audited
handlers are untouched); once per tick the runtime diffs `G.switches`/`G.vars`/
`G.timeOfDay`/`G.pSwitches` against shadows seeded at start and fans the
changes: world cells → `outbox.sharedSet` (persisted in the WorldSnapshot,
fanned to sibling zones), per-player switches → `outbox.recordPatch(pid,
{"pSwitch:ID": v})` (into the PlayerRecord `data` bag persistence already
round-trips). Self-switches are zone-local — never fanned; they ride the
ZoneSnapshot. Transfers → `outbox.transferOut`; modal commands (Show Message/
Choices/…) → the directive broker (`world.directives.send`, already zone-wired).

**Drivers.** `server/src/node/engine-zone.ts` is the one server module that
imports the engine (re-exports `createZoneEventRuntime` + `defaultWorld`,
controlling import order so `headless-env` beats `deps.ts`). Worker path:
`zone-worker.ts` builds the runtime when `workerData.engineRuntime` is set
(threaded through `worker-zone.ts` `engineRuntime`); in-proc path:
`engineZoneFactory` (single-map — a second occupied map warns + falls back to a
plain zone). CLI: `--engine-events` (in-proc single map) or
`--engine-events --zone-workers` (multi-map, one per worker), both in `main.ts`.
Both `dist/beacon.mjs` + `dist/zone-worker.mjs` bundle the engine slice + shim
and evaluate headless (`node beacon.mjs --help` proves it).

**Proof — new tests (NO golden covers a server event runtime, by design).**
- `tests-unit/zone-event-runtime.test.ts` (9, fast pool): the runtime end-to-end
  over a Zone built on `defaultWorld` — autorun flips a world switch →
  `sharedSet` while a self-switch stays zone-local (rides the ZoneSnapshot);
  action button → Show Message directive to the actor; a parallel event → a
  world `var` `sharedSet`; a transfer command → `transferOut` for the acting
  player; stepping onto a touch tile → a per-player switch `recordPatch` (never
  fanned as a world switch); an authored move route advances an NPC (eventStates
  + snapshot carry it); `restoreData` re-applies event positions; a runtime-less
  zone carries NO `events` (MP8·A byte-identical); and the foreign-world /
  double-bind guard.
- `tests-unit/world-engine-events.test.ts` (1, net suite): the BUILT worker
  bundle — a passported player joins a `--engine-events --zone-workers` world,
  presses the action button, and the interpreter running INSIDE the worker
  (against its own `defaultWorld`, headless shim in a real thread) emits a
  message directive that round-trips back over the ZoneApi/ZoneOutbox seam.

**Deviation D-8-6 (scope carried, honest).** This slice delivers the world
coordination surface — world/per-player switches + vars + timeOfDay, transfers,
messages/choices/modal input, self-switches, NPC page resolution + random/route
motion, autorun/parallel/action/touch triggers, common events, the tick-timer
pump. Deferred (documented, not silently dropped): per-player party/inventory/
gold/wallet SPLIT (item/party/heal commands run against a shared world `G` bag
this slice — inert for coordination events; the §A5 per-player durable slices
land with the loadout work), player-targeted move routes (`move target:player` —
NPC routes are the common case), server-side battles/shops/encounters (the
Battle/Shop/encounter services are no-ops — a headless battle system is a
larger lift; touch/action events that open a battle simply resolve the no-op),
quest page-conditions (best-effort against `G.quests`; the server quest runtime
is a later slice), and the record→`G.pSwitches` READ-BACK on rejoin (the WRITE
persists via `recordPatch`; re-hydrating it into the joining player's namespace
needs an admit-time record hook — a follow-up). The MP6 notes (`world.blocking`
participants-only pause, loadout writeback) are carried where they apply now
(the blocking pause is wired + tested); ally-idx/loadout writeback ride the
per-player battle split.

**Wire capability + §A4 re-measure (carry).** Server-driven NPC/event states now
ride the world-zone delta (`events`, additive). CLIENT rendering of them +
dead-reckoning is item 4; growing the harness bots to TRIGGER events and
re-measuring §A4 WITH the interpreter/NPC-motion load (the re-measure that could
move decision #4 — workers becoming CPU-worth-it) rides item 4/5's harness work,
called out again in the hand-off.

**Gate slice (B·1):** root tsc 0 · server tsc Node/CF 0 · eslint 0 · **fast
`test:unit` 1232 → 1241** (85 files; +9 zone-event-runtime) · **net suite 10 →
11** (6 files; +1 world-engine-events, the built-worker proof) · node --test 48
(determinism 46633057 UNTOUCHED — no solo-engine file changed; the new modules
are reachable only from the server bundle path) · both server bundles build +
evaluate headless. No golden or `js/ ?v=` touched (server + additive engine-net
only; solo/friend-room byte-identical).

### B·3 — Cloudflare DO persistent world (D-8-1) ✅ landed 2026-07-20

A persistent world on Cloudflare that SURVIVES hibernation/eviction — the
"free-tier DO plan" self-host option (D2), with no external database.

**`server/src/cf/world-do.ts` — `BeaconWorldDO`.** One Durable Object hosts a
whole `BeaconWorld` (the directory + its in-process map-zones + every player
socket), persisting to the DO's own SQLite-backed storage via
`new KvWorldStore(doStorageKv(state.storage))` — the SAME `KvWorldStore` the
Node target + the unit tests exercise, no CF-specific store code. It closes the
MP5·B "eviction resets the room" boundary the roadmap named: on a cold start the
DO rebuilds the world on the SAME storage and `await world.load()` restores the
§A5 units — the WorldSnapshot (switches/vars/timeOfDay + bans), every
PlayerRecord (a rejoin lands where the player left off), and every ZoneSnapshot
(self-switches + event state) — BEFORE the first client is accepted. The
authoritative 60 Hz sim runs the SAME drift-compensated loop the Node drivers
use (§A3, so a quantized `setInterval` can't halve the sim rate). WebSocket
hibernation (`state.acceptWebSocket`) means an idle world costs no compute; the
storage `alarm` sweeps (1 Hz) and flushes the dirty set every 30 s (§A5 crash
budget ≤ 30 s) + once more on empty before the isolate sleeps.

**`server/src/cf/worker.ts`.** A new `/wrt?world=<name>` route resolves a bounded
world slug to a `BeaconWorldDO` (one DO per named world, default `main`); the
client sends a codeless `join` (a world has one shared room). `BeaconWorldDO` is
exported and bound in `wrangler.jsonc` (`BEACON_WORLD`, migration `v2`
`new_sqlite_classes`). No engine import reaches the CF bundle — the CF world is
the persistent PLAYER-LAYER world (the scale + persistence target); the engine
event runtime on CF (which would need the headless window shim validated inside
workerd) rides the multi-DO work below.

**Proof — `tests-unit/do-store.test.ts` (4, fast pool).** No miniflare in this
rig, so the DO's custom/risky part — its persistence seam — is proven the way
the DO uses it: `doStorageKv` over a faithful in-memory `DurableObjectStorage`
stand-in (get/put/delete/list-by-prefix), then a full `KvWorldStore` round-trip
— WorldSnapshot (shared cells + bans), passport records (the prefix batch-load,
D-8-5; a world/zone key never leaks into the record batch), per-map
ZoneSnapshots (+ `zoneIds`), and a truncated/corrupt unit reading back as empty
rather than throwing (the ungraceful-eviction guard). The DO wrapper itself is
thin over `BeaconWorld` (unit-tested) + `KvWorldStore` (now tested over the CF
seam) + `doStorageKv`; the hibernation/tick lifecycle mirrors the audited
`room-do.ts`; `tsc -p tsconfig.cf.json` type-checks the workerd surface — the
project's established CF coverage bar (no runtime CF tests; `room-do.ts` is the
precedent).

**Deviation D-8-7 (multi-DO zone sharding — prepared, deferred).** This single
DO hosts the whole world, so cross-zone transfer is the in-process gateway (the
socket never moves — no `handoff` needed within one DO), and it scales to what
one isolate can hold (the realistic free-tier world). Sharding zones across
SEPARATE DOs — one DO per zone + `BeaconWorldDO` as the directory DO, the
socket terminating on each zone DO, the `handoff` frame reconnecting a
transferring client to the target zone DO with a token, and cross-DO
world-shared fan-out — is the scale step beyond one isolate. The seams are all
in place (the `handoff` protocol arm from stage A, `doStorageKv`, per-map
ZoneSnapshots) and it is carried as D-8-7; the Node target already meets the
1000-across-8-zones scale gate (§A4/§B·5), so the CF multi-DO split is a
scale-out, not a gate blocker. The client's `handoff` handling still ships in
item 4 so the protocol arm is live.

**Gate slice (B·3):** root tsc 0 · server tsc Node 0 / CF 0 · eslint 0 · **fast
`test:unit` 1241 → 1245** (86 files; +4 do-store) · net suite 11 (unchanged —
CF code isn't socket-tested here) · node --test 48 (determinism untouched — CF
files are not on the solo/Node path) · both Node bundles build. CF changes are
`server/src/cf/*` + `wrangler.jsonc` only; no golden, no `js/ ?v=`, no Node
runtime behaviour touched.

### B·4 — Client world-join (D-8-4) ✅ landed 2026-07-20

The browser client can now enter a PERSISTENT WORLD: it authenticates with the
device passport, joins by address, dead-reckons remote motion at the world's
decimated cadence, and can carry its passport between devices.

**`src/engine/net/relay-client.ts` — the WORLD handshake.** A friend room stays
anonymous (D3): the client sends its `hello` + `join` EAGERLY, byte-identical to
MP5. A WORLD (a `passport` option is present) does NOT: it WAITS for the
server's `challenge`, signs the nonce with the passport, and sends the SIGNED
`hello` (pub/sig) before the codeless `join`/`resume` (a world has one shared
room). A `handoff` frame fires an `onHandoff` reconnect hook (the CF
socket-per-zone arm — D-8-1/D-8-7); a `replaced` kick already surfaces friendly
copy. Proven headless over a mock transport
(`tests-unit/relay-client-world.test.ts`, 4): the world client sends nothing
until the challenge, then a hello whose signature VERIFIES against the nonce
(`verifyChallenge` — exactly the server's check) followed in order by the entry
frame; world-resume signs then resumes with the token; a friend room stays eager
+ anonymous; a handoff fires the hook.

**`src/engine/co-op.ts` — the Play Together flow.** A new `connectWorld(name,
url)` uses `loadOrCreatePassport` (a kid never sees a signup — the passport is
auto-created on first world connect, D3) and wires a world `RelayClient` with
the challenge/handoff/replaced handling; the "Play Together" modal gains a "Join
a World" button that reveals a `wss://` address field (mirroring the join-by-code
reveal), and a passport row — Save Passport (`exportPassportFile` → a downloaded
`.json` the player carries to another device) / Load Passport
(`importPassportFile` → strict-validated replace; a corrupt file never
half-loads). `friendlyError` maps `auth-failed` to plain-language copy.
`reconnectWorld` is the handoff re-dial (resume on the target zone DO with the
handoff token) — wired but exercised only by the deferred multi-DO server path
(D-8-7); single-DO worlds never emit `handoff`.

**Dead-reckoning smoothing — `src/shared/sim/players.ts` `deadReckonRemotes`.** A
world broadcasts DECIMATED (12 Hz + AOI, §A4), so a moving remote's authoritative
position lands only every ~5 ticks. The client (`scenes/map.ts` `clientTick`,
which runs ONLY for a joined client) snapshots prev-tick coords then extrapolates
each moving remote toward its next tile at walk speed, so it GLIDES instead of
stuttering; the next delta reconciles it (`applyPlayerStates` snaps rx/ry). The
advance is capped at the next tile (≤ one tile of overshoot on a late "stopped"
delta). Pure + headless, proven by `tests-unit/dead-reckon.test.ts` (3); a no-op
for an empty roster (solo, byte-identical) and for a friend room (every-tick
broadcast is already smooth). The golden-sensitive render interpolation
(`render-glue.ts` prx→rx) is UNTOUCHED — the smoothing is a separate,
multiplayer-only pass.

**i18n — `src/engine/mp-i18n.ts`.** Nine new player strings (joinWorld,
worldAddress, enteredWorld, passportExport/Import, passportSaved/Loaded/BadFile,
errAuthFailed) added to EN + all ten packs; the parity set is now **43
keys/pack** and `tests-unit/mp-i18n-parity.test.ts` (34) stays green.

**Deviation D-8-8 (carried).** `reconnectWorld` (the handoff re-dial) is wired
but untested against a live server — no target emits `handoff` until the
multi-DO CF split (D-8-7). The dead-reckoning is a cardinal-tile extrapolation
(the common case); diagonal-move remotes fall back to the existing per-frame
interpolation. Both are honest client-feel choices, not gate blockers.

**Gate slice (B·4):** root tsc 0 · server tsc Node/CF 0 · eslint 0 · **fast
`test:unit` 1245 → 1252** (88 files; +4 relay-client-world, +3 dead-reckon) ·
net suite 11 (unchanged) · **i18n parity 34** (43 keys/pack) · node --test 48
(determinism UNTOUCHED — the map.ts change is inside `clientTick`, which never
runs in solo; players.ts gains an additive export). Both Node bundles build. No
golden touched — the Play Together modal is gated behind `multiplayerEnabled`
(absent in the frozen fixtures) and `clientTick` is client-only, so solo is
byte-identical; **the frozen pixel goldens (Playwright) are the MP8 LOAD GATE's
job** (Fable), per the phase workflow. No `js/ ?v=` file touched.

### Remaining stage-B work (hand-off — item 6)

Infra (2, 5) + the engine runtime (1) + the CF persistent world (3) + the client
world-join (4) are green and pushed. The load gate is next; the one open item:

- **Item 6 — encoding:** still NO by measurement (above); revisit only if the
  item-1 runtime deltas move the numbers.

| i18n | mp-i18n parity **34 / 34** (10 packs × the exact 43-key EN set) |
| versions / format | **1.2.0 ×7 sites** · FORMAT_VERSION **2** · **no `js/` file touched beacon-7..HEAD** → no cache-busts owed |
| bundles | `dist/beacon.mjs` + `dist/zone-worker.mjs` build; `beacon.mjs --help` evaluates headless (engine slice + `headless-env` shim stand up in plain Node) |

**Load harness — independent re-measure (fresh runs, solo, no other suites
in flight; §A4/§B·5 recorded numbers in brackets):**

| config | samples | p50 | p95 | p99 | moved | resources (whole process) |
|--------|--------:|----:|----:|----:|------:|:--------------------------|
| 200 bots / 1 zone (in-proc) | 15,498 | 58.0 [58.2–66.5] | **82.6** [82.6–83.1] | 83.8 | 200/200 | 88 MB rss, 4.1 s user / ~22 s |
| 200 / 1 zone + `--data` | 15,507 | 57.6 | **82.3** (flat) | 83.9 | 200/200 | 89 MB rss; 25.8 KB on disk (~129 B/player), graceful flush 6 ms |
| 1000 bots / 8 zones (workers) | 69,799 | 70.7 [69.4–71.3] | **101.8** [99.5–100.1] | 117.3 | 1000/1000 | 259 MB rss, 17.2 s user / ~22 s |
| 200 bots / 8 zones + `--data` (transfer probe) | 13,956 | 66.9 | **82.5** | 83.5 | 200/200 | 85 MB rss; 25 records/mapId ×8 + 8 ZoneSnapshots persisted |

Zone budget (p95 ≤ 250 ms @ 200/zone) holds with **3× headroom**; the
1000/8 world with **2.5×**. The 1000/8 p95 came in 1.7 ms over the recorded
run — measurement noise, both sides of 100 ms across runs. §A4 decisions
re-confirmed: 60 Hz sim · 12 Hz + AOI world broadcast · in-proc Node default ·
encoding NO.

**Transfer under load:** the harness routes every bot through the real
`world.transferPlayer` on the live loaded world (1000 cross-zone transfers in
the world run; every transferred bot then echoed moves in its target zone).
The independent 8-zone `--data` probe shows the records FOLLOW the transfers
durably: exactly 25 records per mapId ×8 on disk + all 8 ZoneSnapshots.
Gateway semantics (leave old zone → admit new → fresh snapshot) unit-proven
in beacon-world.test.ts; the worker-boundary path proven by zone-worker +
world-engine-events (net, ×3).

**Persistence round-trip (kill a zone, restore, state intact):**
world-persistence.test.ts 5/5 (build→play→flush→shutdown→rebuild over BOTH
the memory KV and the real-disk `NodeFileWorldStore`) + the world-smoke net
e2e ×3 (full server kill → new world on the same store → the same passport
rejoins at the saved tile, end-to-end over the socket) + do-store.test.ts 4/4
(the CF DO storage seam, incl. corrupt-unit reads-as-empty). On-disk records
inspected directly: fingerprint-keyed, position + `data` bag only.

**Passport no-PII (verified live, not just by test):** a freshly generated
passport is exactly `{v, kind, name, created, publicKeyJwk, privateKeyJwk}`;
the JWKs carry pure P-256 key material (`kty/x/y/crv/d/key_ops/ext`);
passport.test.ts pins the exact key set. The persisted PlayerRecord is
fingerprint → `{name, mapId, x, y, dir, data, lastSeen}` — no IP, no email,
no account, no device identifier anywhere in the passport, on the wire, or
on disk (D3/D6 posture intact).

**Deferrals ratified as phase boundaries:** D-8-6 (per-player
party/inventory/gold split + server-side battles/shops → the loadout work),
D-8-7 (CF multi-DO zone sharding — seams in place, Node already meets the
scale gate), D-8-8 (handoff re-dial wired but no live target emits `handoff`
until D-8-7), item 6 encoding NO by measurement. The §A4 re-measure WITH
event-runtime bot load (the one that could flip decision 4) rides the next
harness growth, as §B·1 notes.

**Scale-table numbers recorded in the roadmap; tag `beacon-8` pushed. Next:
MP9 (Opus BUILD → Fable RELEASE gate → v2.0.0).**
