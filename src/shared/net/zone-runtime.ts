/* RPGAtlas — src/shared/net/zone-runtime.ts
   Project Beacon MP8·B (item 1, D-8-0): the SEAM between a world zone
   (server/src/core/zone.ts — headless player layer) and the per-zone ENGINE
   event runtime (src/engine/net/zone-event-runtime.ts — interpreter, NPCs,
   events). Both trees import only these DOM-free TYPES, so the zone never
   imports the engine and the engine never imports the server core: the engine
   runtime is injected as a `ZoneRuntimeFactory`.

   Type-only module (interfaces + a factory alias). Lives under src/shared/net
   so the root program and the server program both resolve it; the engine's
   `createZoneEventRuntime` conforms to it and the server's `ZoneOutbox`
   structurally satisfies `ZoneRuntimeOutbox`. GPL-3.0-or-later (see LICENSE). */
