/* RPGAtlas — src/shared/net/protocol.ts
   Project Beacon wire protocol v1 (MP0·A). Every message that ever crosses
   client↔server is defined here as a versioned, typed union — JSON on the
   wire (binary/delta encoding is an MP8 optimization, measured not assumed).
   The decoders are strict structural validators: the server (MP5) feeds every
   inbound frame through decodeClientMessage and treats a null-result as
   hostile input, which is what makes the MP5·D fuzz gate honest. Loopback
   single-player (MP2) passes these same objects by reference — the round-trip
   vitest suite proves wire-safety independently so loopback can skip
   serialization without hiding a wire bug.
   Pure and DOM-free (vitest runs env=node; the sim core depends on this file).
   Forward compatibility: unknown EXTRA fields on a known message are accepted
   (additive evolution within a protocol version); unknown message types are
   rejected. PROTOCOL_VERSION bumps only on breaking shape changes — the
   hello/welcome handshake surfaces a mismatch as the friendly "This game needs
   a newer version" message (client copy, MP5·C).
   Player-facing identity note (D3/D6): a player is a server-assigned numeric
   id plus a display name — nothing else identifies them on the wire. Passport
   public keys (MP8·A) arrive as the additive optional `pub`/`sig` fields on
   `hello`, answered to a world server's `challenge` — friend rooms never send
   a challenge and stay fully anonymous (D3). A passport public key is a
   device-local keypair's public half (no PII by construction, see
   src/shared/net/passport.ts).
