/* RPGAtlas — src/shared/sim/coop-battle.ts
   Project Beacon MP6·A: the shared-battle coordination core — the world half
   of co-op battles (D5). The battle MATH still runs in the engine battle
   scene on the world authority (D-6-0: in MP6 that is the local co-op host
   browser; MP8's per-zone runtime becomes the server home); this module owns
   everything multiplayer about it, headlessly:

   - who fights: partied, proximate players auto-join (A-3), participants
     fixed at start, battler budget split trigger-first (A-4);
   - loadouts: each participant contributes their OWN party over a
     `battleJoin` directive (D-6-1), auto-answered client-side;
   - turn coordination: one `battleCmd` directive per remote participant per
     round, raced against the world-tick AFK deadline (A-5);
   - the participants-only pause: remote participants are blocked players for
     the battle's duration (A-10);
   - disconnect withdrawal (D-6-4) and the per-player battle-event outbox the
   room host drains into `delta.changes.battle` (A-9).

   Presence gate #1 lives here: `openSharedBattle` returns null unless the
   trigger is partied with someone in range — a solo world has no party, so
   the entire MP6 battle surface is unreachable and solo battles keep the
   exact pre-MP6 RNG stream (draw conservation, THE contract).
