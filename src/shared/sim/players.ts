/* RPGAtlas — src/shared/sim/players.ts
   Project Beacon MP4·A: the multi-player roster + entity model. A World has
   always known ONE player (the engine's `G.player`); a Beacon room knows many.
   This module adds the world-side record of the OTHER players sharing the room —
   who they are (id + display name), which map they stand on, and the motion
   state the client renders them with. It is deliberately the SAME motion shape
   the map runtime uses for `G.player` and party followers (x/y + rx/ry render
   coords + prx/pry previous-tick coords for the loop's between-tick
   interpolation), so the renderer draws a remote player through the exact
   follower/player sprite path — a second player is a follower that answers to
   someone else's keyboard.

   Solo-inert by construction (this is what keeps the frozen pixel goldens
   byte-identical): single-player never opens a room, so `world.roster.players`
   stays EMPTY and `local` stays 0. Every reader below (and the render-glue
   remote-player pass) short-circuits on an empty roster, so a solo world
   behaves exactly as it did before MP4.

   Headless by law (sim lint wall): the world stores an appearance KEY
   (`charset`, a string) — resolving it to a spritesheet index is the client's
   job (Assets lives on the DOM side). Nothing here imports Assets, the DOM, or
   any engine module. GPL-3.0-or-later (see LICENSE). */
