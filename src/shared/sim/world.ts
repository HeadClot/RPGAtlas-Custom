/* RPGAtlas — src/shared/sim/world.ts
   Project Beacon MP1·A: the instancing seam of the headless world core. A
   World is ONE running game simulation — everything the MP0·B singleton
   audit classed "world": the game state (the engine's `G`), the world slice
   of the old engine context (live map ref, event runtimes, interpreter
   scheduling maps, the tick clock, cameraZoom) and the gameplay RNG stream.
   `createWorld()` returns a fresh, fully isolated instance: a Beacon server
   hosts many per process; the solo engine binds its historical module-level
   names to ONE default instance through the compat shim
   (src/engine/state/default-world.ts + engine-context.ts + util.ts), so
   every existing import keeps working byte-identically.

   Headless by law: nothing under src/shared/sim/ may import DOM globals,
   deps.ts, audio, or engine modules (MP1·C erects the lint wall; until then
   this header is the contract). Stage B migrates the world *systems*
   (game-state helpers, movement/collision, tile behavior, encounters,
   quests, inventory/wallet, and the scene-module world state the audit
   lists) onto this instance; stage A ships only the seam on purpose.
