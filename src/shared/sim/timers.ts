/* RPGAtlas — src/shared/sim/timers.ts
   Project Beacon MP3·A: the tick-accurate wait/tween timer engine, moved
   verbatim from src/engine/scenes/map.ts onto the world instance it already
   operated on (the timer LIST moved at MP1·B; this moves the functions so a
   headless server-side interpreter can wait without touching the engine).
   `waitTicks(world, n)` = n world ticks — the interpreter's Wait command and
   every timed command tween resolve on the world clock, never wall clock
   (MP0·C §C4: everything is ticks). The pump runs once per world tick, from
   the tick body. The engine's map scene re-exports these bound to the default
   world, so every existing caller is byte-identical. GPL-3.0-or-later. */
