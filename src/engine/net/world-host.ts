/* RPGAtlas — src/engine/net/world-host.ts
   Project Beacon MP2·A: the server side of the loopback split. A `WorldHost`
   owns ONE running world (src/shared/sim/world.ts) and the tick that advances
   it. Clients reach it only through a Transport: inbound `input` frames are
   buffered into a per-tick intent inbox and drained by the world's tick — never
   applied on arrival, so message delivery never re-enters the simulation.

   In single-player this host wraps `defaultWorld` and its transport is the
   server end of a loopback pair (see solo-session.ts); the exact same class is
   what the Beacon relay (MP5) will host per room, over a WebSocket transport.
   That is the whole point of the loopback phase: the code that owns the tick
   and consumes intents is written ONCE, here, and single-player exercises it
   every frame.

   MP2 scope fence: the host owns the tick and the intent inbox; it does NOT yet
   contain the world-write logic (movement/collision/interaction still lives in
   the engine's map scene, which drains this inbox — see scenes/map.ts). The
   world-tick function is injected (`setTickFn`) rather than imported so this
   module stays free of the engine/DOM modules the tick currently touches; the
   full headless extraction of the tick body is a later phase. The delta
   broadcast is a marked no-op: in loopback the client reads the world by
   reference (the mirror IS the world), so there is nothing to serialize yet.
