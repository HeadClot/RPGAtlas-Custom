/* RPGAtlas — src-tauri/src/launch.rs
   Launch-from-a-project plumbing (Project Harbor, Phase H5·A + H5·B). The desktop
   exe can be started with a project path (a `.rpgatlas` file association, or
   `RPGAtlas.exe C:\Games\MyGame` from a shell), and — once tauri-plugin-single-
   instance is registered (H5·B) — a *second* launch hands its path to the already-
   running process instead of starting a new one.

   Both paths funnel through ONE seam so the frontend's existing boot decision
   (boot.ts start() → launchManager) does the actual open:
   - the INITIAL argv is captured in `run()` into a managed `LaunchState` and pulled
     once by the frontend via `take_launch_path` (H5·A);
   - a SECOND launch's argv is pushed to the running frontend as an `atlas://open-
     project` event by the single-instance callback (H5·B, wired in lib.rs).

   The argv → path parse lives here as a pure, cargo-tested function; validation of
   the path (folder vs game.rpgatlas, missing, not-a-project) stays `project_open`'s
   job (project.rs), so a bad path yields the same kid-friendly error taxonomy the
   Project Manager already shows — never a silent drop or a crash.
