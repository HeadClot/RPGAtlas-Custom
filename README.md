**RPGAtlas 2.0** is a complete, original, **free and open source** RPG making engine in the spirit of
classic 2D RPG makers — with a modern **HD-2D renderer** (tilted perspective, dynamic lights and
shadows, animated water, day/night, weather, full post-processing) layered on top. No copyrighted
assets, nothing to install for creators or players — everything (code, tiles, sprites, monsters,
sound effects, even the music) is generated procedurally, imports are welcome when you want them,
and exported games are single self-contained files. (Only working from a *source checkout* needs
free [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/); downloaded copies ship the editor pre-built.)

🕹️ **New in 2.0 — Play Together (online multiplayer).** Tick one checkbox and friends join your game
online with a short **room code**: they walk the same maps, wave and chat, party up, and fight
battles side by side. It's kid-safe by construction — **no accounts, no email, no personal
information**, players connect only to a server (never to each other, so no one's location is ever
exposed), and free-text chat is **off by default** with instant mute + report + owner kick/ban.
Single-player stays byte-for-byte identical until you opt in. Ambitious creators can self-host the
open-source **Beacon** server (plain Node or Cloudflare's free tier) for a persistent world of
hundreds. See [Making Your Game Multiplayer](wiki/Making-Your-Game-Multiplayer.md),
[Hosting a World](wiki/Hosting-a-World.md), and the plain-language
[Online Safety](wiki/Online-Safety.md) page for parents and teachers.

📖 **Documentation:** the [project wiki](wiki/Home.md) — also available as a static
[docs site](docs-site/index.html) (`docs-site/`, GitHub Pages-ready), including the
[Plugin & Script API reference](wiki/Plugin-and-Script-API.md) and the
[Migration Guide](wiki/Migration-Guide.md). Boot the bundled sample, *Atlas Quest*, and walk out to
**Driftwood Shore** for the HD-2D showcase.

🎮 **Coming from RPG Maker MV / MZ?** **File ▸ Import from RPG Maker…** brings your own MV or MZ
project in — maps, database, events, switches/variables, and common events — with a plain-language
report of what came along and what to touch up. See
[Coming from RPG Maker](wiki/Coming-from-RPG-Maker.md).

## Quick start

**Windows — just double-click `RPGAtlas.exe`.** On a downloaded copy (which ships the pre-built
editor) it starts a tiny local server and opens the editor in your browser — no Python, no Node, no
install, no admin rights. Keep the little black window open while you work; close it to stop.
(Windows may show an "unknown publisher" warning the first time — the launcher is unsigned; choose
*More info → Run anyway*.)

Working from a **source checkout** (git clone) instead? The editor source is TypeScript, which needs
the Vite dev server: install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18 or newer, run `npm install` once in
the RPGAtlas folder, and the same double-click then works — the launcher detects the tooling and
boots Vite automatically.

The launcher picks the first free port in the **8080–8099** range (the address is printed in the
black window). Pass `--no-browser` if you don't want it to open a browser tab automatically.

Want it on your Desktop? Double-click **`Create Desktop Shortcut.cmd`** once and an RPGAtlas icon appears
on your Desktop — launch from there any time.

Why a launcher at all? Browsers block `localStorage`/file access on `file://` pages, so the engine has
to be served over `http://` — and a source checkout's TypeScript editor additionally needs Vite to
translate it on the fly. The `.exe` handles both for you.

**Other platforms (or no `.exe`)** — serve it yourself. On a downloaded (pre-built) copy any static
server works, e.g. `python -m http.server 8080` in the folder; on a source checkout run
`npm install` once, then `npm run dev`.

Then open the printed **http://localhost:…** address — that's the editor. Either way, hit
**▶ Playtest** to play your game (or open `play.html` on the same address to play the bundled sample,
*Atlas Quest*).

> Building the launcher from source: run `tools/build-engine-launcher.ps1` (uses the .NET Framework C#
> compiler already present on Windows). This produces `RPGAtlas.exe` in the project root.

## Your game is a folder (desktop app)

The **RPGAtlas desktop app** (`RPGAtlas-Desktop.exe`, its own window — distinct from the browser
launcher above) works the way RPG Maker and Godot do: **every game is a real folder on your
computer**. It opens to a **Project Manager** (New Project / Open Project / recent games) instead of
the editor; creating a game scaffolds a folder, opening one boots the editor on it. A game folder
looks like:

```text
My Game/
  game.rpgatlas   the game itself (double-click to open it)
  assets/         drop your own art & audio here: characters, facesets, enemies, tilesets, audio
  .atlas/         RPGAtlas's helper files (asset index, sliced-tile cache, rolling backups)
  saves/          playtest save slots
```

Your work **autosaves straight into the folder** (`game.rpgatlas`, written atomically with a rolling
backup) — no "save to a file" step. Drop a picture or sound into the matching `assets/` subfolder and
it appears in the editor when you switch back (or click **Scan for New Files**); your files are never
moved or renamed. Because everything a game needs is in its folder, you can **zip it, move it, or back
it up** and it just works. **File ▸ Export Project As File…** still makes a shareable single-file copy
with its assets baked in. Opening a game made in an older desktop build offers a one-click
**"put your game in a folder"** migration. Full guide:
[Your Game Is a Folder](wiki/Your-Game-Is-a-Folder.md) ·
[Adding Your Own Art and Music](wiki/Adding-Your-Own-Art-and-Music.md).

### Opening a game by double-clicking it

The file inside a game folder named **`game.rpgatlas`** is that game's project file. Hand the desktop
app one and it opens straight into that game, skipping the Project Manager:

- **Double-click a `game.rpgatlas` file** (once the association is set up — see below).
- **From a shortcut or terminal:** `RPGAtlas-Desktop.exe "C:\Games\My Game"` — pass either the game's
  **folder** or its `game.rpgatlas` file. A path that isn't a game just opens the Project Manager with
  a friendly note.
- **Already running?** RPGAtlas won't start a second copy. Double-clicking another game brings the
  open window to the front and switches to that game — saving the one you were working on first.

### Windows: making `.rpgatlas` open with RPGAtlas

A future **installer** registers `.rpgatlas` for you (icon and all). With the **portable
`RPGAtlas-Desktop.exe`** (no installer), tell Windows once which app to use:

1. Right-click any **`game.rpgatlas`** file → **Open with** → **Choose another app**.
2. Pick **RPGAtlas** if it's listed, or **Choose an app on your PC** / **More apps ▸ Look for another
   app on this PC** and browse to your **`RPGAtlas-Desktop.exe`**.
3. Tick **Always use this app to open .rpgatlas files**, then **OK**.

From then on, double-clicking any game's `game.rpgatlas` opens it in RPGAtlas. (Only the desktop app
opens `.rpgatlas` files this way — the browser launcher `RPGAtlas.exe` just serves the editor.)

## The editor (`index.html`)

A classic RPG-maker layout: menu bar (File / Edit / Mode / Draw / Layer / Advanced / Scale / View / Tools / Generators / Game / Help)
plus an icon toolbar with everything one click away.

| Area | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Map mode** | Paint tiles on 4 layers (Ground / Decor / Decor 2 / Overhead) with Pen, Eraser, Rectangle, Circle, Fill and Shadow Pen tools — or use the **Auto layer**, which sorts terrain vs. decorations for you |
| **Event mode** | Double-click a cell to create/edit an event; drag events to move them |
| **Passability mode** | See ○/✕ for every tile and click to override (auto → force block → force pass) |
| **Height mode (HD-2D)** | Paint per-tile elevation with the same Pen/Rectangle/Circle/Fill tools (keys 0–9 set the value); raised tiles extrude into 3D blocks in HD-2D rendering |
| **HD-2D rendering** | Per-map opt-in WebGL2 mode: tilted perspective camera, extruded terrain, billboard sprites, bloom, depth of field, distance fog and point lights (events named `light #rrggbb radius`); live preview panel in the editor; falls back to the classic 2D renderer automatically |
| **Cut / Copy / Paste** | Shift+drag selects a tile region (all layers + shadows + heights); events copy/paste too |
| **Undo / Redo** | Full-map history for tiles, shadows, heights, passability and events |
| **Database** | Actors, Classes, Skills, Items, Weapons, Armors, Enemies, Troops, Common Events, States, Switches, Variables, System |
| **Dialogue & Cutscenes** | Build reusable conversation trees with speakers, portraits, voice cues, conditions, player choices, localization keys, embedded event commands, and preview |
| **System tab** | Game screen width/height, UI area size, screen scale, message & menu fonts, font size, window color and opacity, remappable system sounds & music themes, side-view or front-view battles, start-transparent player |
| **States** | Poison / stun / regen-style battle effects with per-turn HP %, act restriction, duration and battle-end removal; skills can inflict or cure them |
| **Plugin Manager** | Project-embedded JavaScript with boot, map-load and per-frame hooks |
| **Audio Manager** | Preview every procedural sound effect and music theme |
| **Event Searcher** | Find message text, event names, or switch/variable usage across all maps |
| **Resource Manager** | Browse every generated tile/character/battler; export PNGs (incl. full sprite sheets) |
| **Character Generator** | Build, preview, save, and export 4- or 8-direction walking sprites with distinct Classic, Chibi, Heroic, and Storybook bodies, outfits, hair, and accessories |
| **Generator Hub** | Create batches of names and story hooks with 20 generators for weapons, armor, spells, currencies, items, enemies, characters, factions, settlements, kingdoms, dungeons, taverns, potions, artifacts, quests, deities, ships, books, plants, and festivals |
| **Map Properties** | Rename/resize maps, set music, configure random encounters, enable HD-2D (camera tilt, bloom, depth of field, fog color, lights, ambient) |
| **Open / Export** | Back up the project as `.json` or export a self-contained Windows `.exe` / playable `.html` |

## Custom assets

**Desktop app:** the easiest way to add your own art and audio is to drop files into your game's own
`assets/` folder (or import through **Tools ▸ Asset Browser**) — see
[Adding Your Own Art and Music](wiki/Adding-Your-Own-Art-and-Music.md). The shared `img/` folders
below are the engine's built-in library, used when running RPGAtlas from a source checkout or sharing
art across projects:

```text
img/characters   walking sprite sheets (3 columns x 4 directions; generator exports can also use 8 rows)
img/facesets     actor portraits matched by filename
img/enemies      enemy battle images
img/tilesets     individual map tiles
img/system       shared UI graphics, including the 8x8 database icon sheet
```

Copy files into the appropriate folder and reload the editor. They automatically appear in the relevant
database picker or map palette. Custom tile filenames control passability:

- `stone.png` is blocked.
- `bridge.pass.png` is passable.
- `meadow.terrain.png` is passable and selected as terrain by Auto Layer.

See [`img/README.md`](img/README.md) for formats. On downloaded copies the launcher's server provides
the directory listings the scan needs; on a source checkout the Vite dev server doesn't — there, run
`tools/update-assets.ps1` to write the `img/assets.json` manifest, then reload.
Projects save references rather than image copies, and standalone exports embed only referenced files.

Classes, skills, items, weapons, armors, enemies, and states each have a selectable icon. Click
**Add Icons…** in any icon picker to append 32x32 images or sheets to the current project. Replace
`img/system/icon_set.png` with another transparent 256x512, 8x16 sheet to reskin the 128 built-ins.

Shortcuts: `B/E/R/O/F/S` tools · `0` auto layer, `1–4` layers · `+/-` & `Ctrl`+wheel zoom, `Ctrl+0` 1:1 ·
right-click = pick tile · `Ctrl+Z/Y` undo/redo · `Ctrl+X/C/V` clipboard · `Del` delete selected event.

During an editor-launched Playtest, hold `Ctrl` for developer-only Through movement; deployed games
never enable this control.

Passability is per-tile: the topmost decoration tile decides, otherwise the Ground tile —
and Passability mode can override any cell. Overhead tiles draw above the player (treetops, roof edges…).
The Shadow Pen paints half-tile shadow quadrants, just like the classics.

### Events

Events have **pages** with conditions (switch, variable, self-switch); the last matching page is active.
Triggers: Action button, Player touch, Autorun, Parallel. Commands include:

Show Text · Show Choices · Play Dialogue · Conditional Branch · Control Switch / Self-Switch / Variable ·
Transfer Player · Change Gold / Items / Party · Heal · Start Battle · Open Shop · Set Move Route ·
Camera Zoom · Change Transparency · Wait · Play Sound · Change Music · Erase Event · Save Screen · Game Over ·
Return to Title · Script (JS)

## The player (`play.html`)

- Grid movement with smooth scrolling camera (Arrows/WASD, **Shift** to dash), with optional
  eight-direction diagonal steps enabled from Database > System > Map systems
- **Z/Enter** confirm/interact · **X/Esc** menu/cancel — mouse works everywhere too
- Message windows with typewriter text, optional speaker faces, inline `\i[n]` icons, and choices
- Full pause menu: Items, Skills, Equip, Status, Save/Load (3 slots), Return to Title
- Turn-based battles in **side view** (animated party sprites) or classic front view:
  Attack / Skills / Items / Guard / Escape, agility turn order, multi-target spells,
  **states** (poison, stun, regen…), EXP/levels/skill learning, gold drops, random encounters
- Twelve procedural enemy families with distinct silhouettes, idle motion, stats, and combat roles
- Pooled combat particles for movement, impacts, skills, magic, healing, guarding, states, and defeats
- Configurable class traits for stats, resistances, skill bonuses, equipment, and combat rules
- Shops with buy/sell, procedural chiptune music & sound effects
- Presentation is project-driven: screen size, UI area, scale, fonts, font size, window color and opacity
  all come from the Database System tab

## Plugins

Projects embed plain-JavaScript plugins that run at game boot. Each plugin receives the `atlas`
engine bridge (`atlas.onMapLoad`, `atlas.onRender`, `atlas.onMessageText`, `atlas.setTransition`,
`atlas.registerCommand`, `atlas.startBattle`, …) and the `game` script API. Four built-ins ship with
every new project:

- **Atlas_Core** — shared plugin registry and helpers (colors, easing, tweens, RNG)
- **Atlas_TextCodes** — inline icons with `\i[n]`, `\c[n]` color codes, and BBCode (`[b]`, `[i]`, `[color]`, `[size]`) in messages
- **Atlas_Transitions** — transfer effects: fade, iris, curtain, slide (`Atlas.transition = 'iris'`)
- **Atlas_Weather** — rain, storm, snow and fog overlays, per-map or scripted (`Atlas.weather('rain', 6)`)

## Developing the engine

Using RPGAtlas needs no tooling at all — the sections above work by serving the folder as
static files. Contributing to the engine uses a modern toolchain (Node 20+):

```
npm install
npm run dev        # Vite dev server for editor + player
npm test           # engine test suites (node --test)
npm run test:unit  # vitest unit tests
npm run test:e2e   # Playwright smoke + golden-image render tests
npm run build      # production build in dist/ (verbatim runtime passthrough)
npm run typecheck  # TypeScript (new code is TS; legacy JS migrates per phase)
npm run lint
```

The eight-phase "Atlas HD" overhaul that produced 1.0 is documented in
[`docs/PRODUCTION_ROADMAP.md`](docs/PRODUCTION_ROADMAP.md) (with per-phase specs beside it) —
see [`docs/architectural_overview.md`](docs/architectural_overview.md) for how the codebase
fits together.

## Code structure

TypeScript modules under `src/` hold the engine (`src/engine/` — scenes, interpreter, state),
the editor (`src/editor/` — map editor, database, dock workspace, tools, importers), the
three.js HD-2D renderer (`src/renderer/`), shared services (`src/shared/`), and the storage
platform adapters (`src/platform/` — browser and Tauri). The procedural asset/audio/data
generators remain classic scripts under `js/` (`assets.js`, `sfx.js`, `data.js`) alongside
`js/editor/project-io.js` (persistence/export) and `js/standalone-template.mjs` +
`js/build-manifest.mjs` (the shared export/packaging pipeline). Shared engine services such
as `Assets`, `RA`, and the plugin bridge remain stable globals for plugin compatibility.

## Publishing a game

Choose **File > Export Standalone Game** to build the current project as:

- **Windows EXE** — a small launcher with the complete game appended inside it. Double-clicking the
  executable extracts the game and opens it in the player's default modern browser.
- **Standalone HTML** — one cross-platform game file that can be opened directly in a modern browser.
- **Web / itch.io (.zip)** — `index.html` at the zip root (itch.io's HTML5 layout) plus a web-app
  manifest, icons, and an offline service worker: host it anywhere static and players can install
  it like an app and replay offline.

With the Rust toolchain, `node scripts/package-game-exe.mjs <project.json>` additionally packages
any exported project as a **native desktop executable** (its own window, no browser) using the same
Tauri shell as the RPGAtlas desktop app.

Players do not need RPGAtlas, the editor, a local web server, or a separate project file.
Save slots are stored by the player's browser. The Windows launcher is unsigned, so Windows may show
a security warning for downloaded builds. Full guide: [Publishing Your Game](wiki/Publishing-Your-Game.md).

## Project format

Everything lives in one JSON document — autosaved to your browser in the web version, or written
into your game folder as `game.rpgatlas` in the desktop app (see
[Your game is a folder](#your-game-is-a-folder-desktop-app)):

```
system      – title, start position/transparency, party, gold, currency, switch/variable names,
              screen & UI size, scale, fonts, window opacity, system sounds/music, battle view
states      – battle states: per-turn HP %, act restriction, duration, colors & icons
assets      – stable references for shared custom assets
actors      – name, class, level, sprite, starting equipment
classes     – base stats, per-level growth, traits, equipment permissions + skill learnings
skills      – icon, physical / magical / heal, power, MP cost, scope
items / weapons / armors – icon, effects, prices and parameters
enemies     – stats, rewards, weighted action list, procedural sprite + tint
troops      – enemy groups for battles
maps        – 4 tile layers, shadow + passability-override grids, events
plugins     – name + JS code + enabled flag, run in order at game boot
customChars – sprites built in the Character Generator
```

Projects created with the engine's pre-rebrand release (Driftwood Engine) open and migrate
automatically — autosaves, save slots, and bundled plugins are all carried forward.
