/* RPGAtlas — vitest.net.config.mjs
   Project Beacon MP5: an ISOLATED, SERIAL runner for the Beacon tests that use
   REAL TCP WebSockets + a live 60 Hz server tick (beacon-ws, relay-client, and
   the beacon-load latency gate). Real sockets + real timers are timing-
   sensitive: run in the main parallel pool they both starve perf-budget tests
   (mz-scale-import) AND flake each other under CPU contention. `npm run
   test:net` runs them alone, one file at a time, so they are reliable and hurt
   nothing else. The rest of the Beacon suite (collision, server core + fuzz)
   uses in-memory mock connections and stays in the fast parallel pool.
